* In biofilm.f:
  - "dcoef" is not defined.
    dcoef=3 as in watqual.f?
    Then, I propose at beginning:
    real*8, parameter :: dcoef = 3.

* In bmp_ri_pond.f:
  - "qseep" and "qet" could be used not initialized at lines 133 and 134. 
    However the problem only arises for "nstep<1"

  - "sed_removed" at line 342 can be used not initialized if "sfsedstdev<=0"

* In bmp_wet_pond.f:
  - "hvol" can be used not initialized in "ext_dpth" subroutine at line 267 in
    first bucle iteration

* In clicon.f:
  - "tmxbsb", "tmnbsb", "rbsb", "rstpbsb", "rhdbsb", "rabsb", "rmxbsb",
    "daylbsb", "fradbsb" and "u10bsb" could be used not initialized at 186-207
    lines

* In conapply.f:
  - "k" and "kk" could be used not initialized at 121-122 lines if
    "iday_pest(j)/=ipst_freq(j) and curyr>nyskip"

* In confert.f:
  - "ifrt" seems to be "it" at line 214

* In curno.f:
  - "smxold" can be used not initialized if "cn1(h)<=1.e-6 and curyr/=0" at line
    96

* In drains.f:
  - "nlayer" could be used not initialized at line 23. However, yhe problem only
    arises if it is not set in the previous bucle (mlyr<=1 or sol_z(j1,j)<=0)

* In etact.f:
  - "sev" can be used not initialized at line 286 if "dep>=esd and ly==2"

* In filter.f:
  - "remove21" seems to be "remove2" at line 316

* In grass_wway.f:
  - "sf_depth" and "sf_sed" could be used not initialized at lines 133 and 137
    if "sf_area>0 and sf_area<=1.e-6"

* In hhnoqual.f:
  - "algon" seems to be "algcon" at line 190

* In hhwatqual.f
  - "orgnpin" seems to be "orgpin" at line 278
  - "thour=1.0" at line 377 overwrites previous "thour" calculation. It is wrong

* In hmeas.f:
  - "rhdbsb" could be used not initialized at line 84

* In killop.f:
  - "ff1" and "ff2" are not defined at lines 167 and 267.
    They are set in harvkillop.f file (lines 257-258).
    They have to be included in modparm.f to share harvkillop.f values?
    or they have to be redefined as in harvkillop.f?

* In NCsed_leach.f90:
  - "perc_clyr" could be used not initialized at line 221 if "sol_nly(j)<2"

* In nrain.f:
  - "no2pcp" seems to be "no3pcp" at line 72

* In pmeas.f:
  - "rbsb" could be used not initialized at line 143
  - "flag" could be used not initialized if "a==' ' at line 210
  - "rainsb" could be used not initialized, however only if "nstep<=0"

* In pminrl2.f:
  - "ssp" can be used not initialized at line 196 if "xx<=1.e-6"

* In pothole.f:
  - "solp_tileo" could be used not initialized at line 593 if
    "pot_vol(j)<=1.e-6 or potvol_tile<=1.e-6"

* In potholehr.f:
  - "potflow" seems to be "potflwo" at line 447

* In readatmodep.f:
  - "momax=12*nbyr" is defined at line 65 but not used.
    It has to be "mo_max"? but then, it overwrites the file read

* In readops.f:
  - "year = 0." seems to be "iyear = 0" at line 98
  - "mg13" seems to be "mgt13" at line 206

* In readpnd.f:
  - "vselsetlpnd" seems to be "velsetlpnd" at line 279

* In readru.f:
  - "tck" is used but not initialized at line 79

* In rewind_init.f:
  - "orig_tnylda" is used but not initialized at line 174

* In routels.f:
  - "dstor" is used but not initialized at line 134.
    It has to be calculated as in watbal.f?
    or as in the commented line 109?
  - "latqout" and "gwqout" could be used not initialized at lines 142-143

* In rtbact.f:
  - "netwtr" could be used not initialized at line 124, however only in
    "nstep<1"

* In rthpest.f:
  - "thour=1.0" at line 183 overwrites previous "thour" calculation. It is wrong
  - "frsol" and "frsrb" could be used not initialized at lines 289-290 if
    "hrtwtr(ii)>0.001 and hrtwtr(ii)/(idt*60)<=0.01"

* In rtpest.f:
  - "tday=1.0" at line 180 overwrites previous "tday" calculation. It is wrong

* In sched_mgt.f:
  - "husc" and "igrow" at lines 264-265 are used but not initialized.
    "husc" has to be "phu_op(iop,ihru)" has in readmgt.f?
    "igrow" has to be "igro(ihru)" has in readmgt.f?

* In smeas.f:
  - "rabsb" could be used not initialized at line 86

* In sweep.f:
  - "fr_curb" is used but not initialized at line 56.
    It has to be added to modparm.f to share result with sched_mgt.f?
    or it has to be "mgt5op(nop(ihru),ihru)" as in sched_mgt.f?

* In tmeas.f:
  - "tmxbsb" and "tmnbsb" could be used not initialized at lines 109-110

* In transfer.f:
  - "ratio", "xx" and "ratio1" could be used not initialized at lines 236, 239

  - "stp_stagdis" seems to be "dtp_stagdis" at line 84
  - "subdr_kg" seems to be "subdr_km" at line 149
  - "spl_eros" is not defined at line 21, it could be "eros_spl"?
